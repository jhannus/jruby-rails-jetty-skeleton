This is a skeleton project showing how to combine these things:

* Rails 3.2.3
* JRuby 1.6.7
* Jetty 8.1.3

plus these development/build tools:

* Warbler 1.3.5 for assembling the rails webapp
* Maven 3 for maintaining additional java dependencies that the Rails app might need, and for assembling the final artifact (tar.gz containing jetty and the web app)
